&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="heatsinks" src="/images/heatsinks.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very happy with the connectors (Pro Power&amp;#8217;s minipower series).  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only had two MOSFETs and was lacking in connectors, but it was enough to
test.  Everything fit beautifully and soldered up&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanting to test things, I connected the board to an &lt;a href="arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardo"&gt;Arduino
Leonardo&lt;/a&gt; with some basic test code, and
it worked!  It only took a short while more to write the Leonardo firmware to
accept frames over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; and drive the shift registers appropriately.  It
took an even shorter while to write a sink plugin for the control&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;

Further software refinements led to a Tkinter-based sink to
make visualisation&amp;nbsp;easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tkinter GUI" src="/images/tkinter.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also stuck together a simple sink using pylibftdi in bitbang mode, which was
even easier than I expected. It generates the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRCK&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCK&lt;/span&gt; signals for
the shift registers using three pins on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTDI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile David was busy finishing up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt; design (more on that later).
Afterwards he stuck together the prototype electronics on a breadboard,
connected up the relays and two (of the eventual 49) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strips and we tried
hooking it all up for the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all worked! Additionally the relays sounded great on one of the aluminium
poles. This is a very positive result and we&amp;#8217;re now confident that the
electronics design, software design, and various other choices that led to this
moment were at least on the right track.  All that&amp;#8217;s left is the actual PCBs,
the hard parts of the software (person tracking!) and a million other
tasks-to-do before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="electronics"></category><category term="software"></category></entry><entry><title>Control Software</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/12/control-software" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-12:2014/07/12/control-software</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night we started fleshing out the design for the control software. The
bulk of it will be written in Python, because we&amp;#8217;re both familiar with the
language and it has good bindings to libFTDI and&amp;nbsp;OpenCV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I sketched out an outline of the overall&amp;nbsp;design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="paper planning" src="/images/software_plan.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a central &amp;#8216;Control&amp;#8217; object which is responsible for tying everything
together, and externally we&amp;#8217;ll use &lt;a href="http://supervisord.org/"&gt;supervisord&lt;/a&gt; to
start and manage it. It starts an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and Tracking process via multiprocessing,
and loads up all the Patterns and Sinks it knows about and waits for&amp;nbsp;instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is in a separate process and uses the wonderful
&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; library, with a Queue to pass commands back to
the Control process. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; receives (command, value) pairs from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;
requests, checks the authentication against the settings, then sends the
command on. Later we&amp;#8217;ll probably extend this to also return data about the
current state of the system, for example which Patterns are&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tracking process will use &lt;a href="http://opencv.org/"&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; to detect people in
the grid, estimate the position of their feet in the 2d (top-down) grid via
projective transforms, assign each person a unique number and keep track of
them for as long as they remain in the grid. This is probably going to be one
of the more challenging components to write! It passes this data back to the
Control process and the Patterns via a proxied dict through a multiprocessing
Manager&amp;nbsp;object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterns and Sinks are similar. Both have their own package for all the pattern
or sink files, a top level class to inherit from, and register themselves with
the system using a decorator. For Patterns, the decorator also allows a
configuration to be registered, so that for example the maze pattern can offer
one- or two-player patterns. Patterns will have an update() method called
which returns a full grid state frame (a 7x7 boolean array) and a time to
display the frame for. Sinks have update(state) called with the state from a
pattern, and somehow output that pattern, for example to the real hardware on
the&amp;nbsp;grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="source code screenshot" src="/images/code_screenshot.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got coding. In a few hours and 230 lines of Python we now have a
complete working barebones system, with Control implemented, a simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that
can load patterns and sinks, the pattern and sink registration and loading
system, settings management, logging and a few other bits. Tracking is still an
empty shell at the moment, and we&amp;#8217;ll be working on the Console sink before the
real hardware one (useful for debugging). Patterns are going to come later too,
but at least they have something to slot into now. Eventually we&amp;#8217;ll be adding
an Android app to the mix which uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for remote control, but that is
pretty far down the to-do&amp;nbsp;list!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="software"></category></entry><entry><title>Testing LED strips and a PSU</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/11/testing-led-strips-and-a-psu" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>David</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-11:2014/07/11/testing-led-strips-and-a-psu</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a lot of parcels today!  The LEDs, thermal compound, some relays,
and what we have affectionately termed The Danger&amp;nbsp;Cable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="schematic" src="/images/danger_cable.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first we weren&amp;#8217;t convinced the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strips would be bright enough.  A quick
test in the garden cleared any doubts about the&amp;nbsp;brightness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lightsabre" src="/images/lightsabre.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I finished putting the power supply back together after a good clean
and a fresh dab of thermal grease.  After a little sanity testing, we thought
we&amp;#8217;d give it some&amp;nbsp;load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="power supply testing" src="/images/psu_test.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

of epoxy sealed the deal.  Testing will have to wait until we get a few more
parts, but it looks&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a number of interesting ideas for making the electronics easier.
Instead of using an Arduino to talk over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; and drive the shift registers (and
have yet another layer of software in the stack), it turns out you can use
several of the pins on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTDI&lt;/span&gt; ft232r as GPIOs and use it to drive shift
registers&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, I was making a quick stripboard prototype with a shift
register and some PMOSes and complaining bitterly to Adam about cutting
stripboard tracks.  We shortly decided that it was, in fact, a rather good idea
to make a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;.  Instead of one massive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;, we could break it down to 7 PCBs,
each with a shift register and 7 outputs.  We can cascade the boards&amp;#8217; shift
registers and connect each board directly to a power supply.  Surprisingly
quickly, the schematic looked something like&amp;nbsp;this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="schematic" src="/images/pcb_schematic.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all just about barely fits on a 5cm x 5cm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;: (surface mount resistors
omitted for clarity, but they look like they&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;fit&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_55" src="/images/pcb_55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a 10cm x 5cm board, everything gets a lot more comfortable, a looks a
little&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_long" src="/images/pcb_long.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, with the PCBs all lined up the LEDs will look something like a
grid.  In the end we went back to using through-hole components for everything.
Surface mount resistors would be smaller and cheaper, but through-hole is a lot
more&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="electronics"></category><category term="power"></category></entry><entry><title>Aluminium Arrived (at last)</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/09/aluminium-arrived-at-last" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-09:2014/07/09/aluminium-arrived-at-last</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After some more wrangling with the online vehicle tracking, we eventually had a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="aluminium in the garden" src="/images/alu_in_garden.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours of hard sawing, filing and taping up later, and we now have eight

of&amp;nbsp;TheGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="adam sawing" src="/images/adam_sawing.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also opened up one of the power supplies to investigate the design and
quality. True to the &amp;#8220;Professional&amp;#8221; sticker on the box, the insides included a
large toroid that had torn free of its soldering, so we&amp;#8217;ll probably need to do
a little rework before these are&amp;nbsp;shipshape.&lt;/p&gt;

driving of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strip, and therefore P-channel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOSFET&lt;/span&gt; drivers.  This
would&amp;#8217;ve required another row of transistors to interface between our shift
registers and the MOSFETs, except for Matt&amp;#8217;s (thanks!) neat idea of using shift
registers with open-drain drivers.  Prototype parts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt; tomorrow, so we&amp;#8217;ll see
how the idea stands up to&amp;nbsp;testing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="LEDs"></category><category term="electronics"></category></entry><entry><title>175m Aluminium Angle on its way…</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/06/175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-06:2014/07/06/175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is all feeling much more real now as we&amp;#8217;ve just placed the order for 35 5m
lengths of aluminium equal angle. It should arrive Tuesday, apparently! I can
only imagine how confused the delivery driver will be when the address is a
residental&amp;nbsp;house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the order" src="/images/alu_order.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve now also finished the prototype design for the control electronics and
ordered a few samples to test drive. Hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll have flashing LEDs by the
end of the&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="structures"></category><category term="electronics"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/05/welcome" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dr House Industries</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-05:2014/07/05/welcome</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The·Grid is an art/engineering installation to be displayed at &lt;a href="http://www.emfcamp.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMF&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, I bought £70 worth of 12V PSUs (150A worth) and we set up this&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="power"></category></entry></feed>
