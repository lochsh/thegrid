of epoxy sealed the deal.  Testing will have to wait until we get a few more
parts, but it looks&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a number of interesting ideas for making the electronics easier.
Instead of using an Arduino to talk over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; and drive the shift registers (and
have yet another layer of software in the stack), it turns out you can use
several of the pins on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTDI&lt;/span&gt; ft232r as GPIOs and use it to drive shift
registers&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, I was making a quick stripboard prototype with a shift
register and some PMOSes and complaining bitterly to Adam about cutting
stripboard tracks.  We shortly decided that it was, in fact, a rather good idea
to make a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;.  Instead of one massive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;, we could break it down to 7 PCBs,
each with a shift register and 7 outputs.  We can cascade the boards&amp;#8217; shift
registers and connect each board directly to a power supply.  Surprisingly
quickly, the schematic looked something like&amp;nbsp;this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="schematic" src="/images/pcb_schematic.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all just about barely fits on a 5cm x 5cm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;: (surface mount resistors
omitted for clarity, but they look like they&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;fit&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_55" src="/images/pcb_55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a 10cm x 5cm board, everything gets a lot more comfortable, a looks a
little&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_long" src="/images/pcb_long.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, with the PCBs all lined up the LEDs will look something like a
grid.  In the end we went back to using through-hole components for everything.
Surface mount resistors would be smaller and cheaper, but through-hole is a lot
more&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="electronics"></category><category term="power"></category></entry><entry><title>Aluminium Arrived (at last)</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/aluminium-arrived-at-last.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-09:aluminium-arrived-at-last.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After some more wrangling with the online vehicle tracking, we eventually had a
firm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230; in the past. It slipped slowly further back in time until the
estimated delivery was an hour&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="delivery tracking..." src="/images/eta_the_past.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the aluminium did eventually make it to the present time and we happily
took&amp;nbsp;delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="aluminium in the garden" src="/images/alu_in_garden.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours of hard sawing, filing and taping up later, and we now have eight
bundles of aluminium angle, all ready to be used for the structural component
of&amp;nbsp;TheGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="adam sawing" src="/images/adam_sawing.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also opened up one of the power supplies to investigate the design and
quality. True to the &amp;#8220;Professional&amp;#8221; sticker on the box, the insides included a
large toroid that had torn free of its soldering, so we&amp;#8217;ll probably need to do
a little rework before these are&amp;nbsp;shipshape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="i'm sure this PSU is just fine" src="/images/psu_dodgy_transformer.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the prototype electronics have also arrived, so we&amp;#8217;re ready to
start testing the control electronics. Hopefully the first LEDs (to verify
colour choice) will be arriving tomorrow so we can light something&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="structures"></category><category term="power"></category></entry><entry><title>PSUs arrived (aluminium didn’t)</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/psus-arrived-aluminium-didnt.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-08:psus-arrived-aluminium-didnt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five of the most legitimate 30A 12V PSUs you can find on eBay arrived today:

sample rolls of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strip.  We couldn&amp;#8217;t decide whether &amp;#8220;Pure/Day White&amp;#8221; or
&amp;#8220;Cool White&amp;#8221; sounded more appropriate, so we&amp;#8217;re going to check out&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, the electronics design is significantly taking shape.  After a
number of iterations and a lot of discussion, we decided we want high-side
driving of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strip, and therefore P-channel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOSFET&lt;/span&gt; drivers.  This
would&amp;#8217;ve required another row of transistors to interface between our shift
registers and the MOSFETs, except for Matt&amp;#8217;s (thanks!) neat idea of using shift
registers with open-drain drivers.  Prototype parts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt; tomorrow, so we&amp;#8217;ll see
how the idea stands up to&amp;nbsp;testing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="LEDs"></category><category term="electronics"></category></entry><entry><title>175m Aluminium Angle on its way…</title><link href="http://www.thegrid.fish/175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Adam</name></author><id>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-06:175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is all feeling much more real now as we&amp;#8217;ve just placed the order for 35 5m

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the order" src="/images/alu_order.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve now also finished the prototype design for the control electronics and
