They&amp;#8217;re with fab house and should be manufactured by the beginning of next week
and with us by the end of next week.  Before they went to fab, I made a few
minor changes, mainly to increase clearance and track width.  This should make
the board pretty hard to get wrong, meaning we get a good&amp;nbsp;yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the updated gerbers, rendered by &lt;a href="http://dirtypcbs.com/"&gt;Dirty PCBs&lt;/a&gt;
in a rendition of their final yellow&amp;nbsp;soldermask:&lt;/p&gt;

Less than 48 hours
from deciding to do a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt; to submitting Gerbers has got to be a&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll try to talk some more about some of the design choices when I&amp;#8217;ve had more
sleep.  For now, here&amp;#8217;s what it looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gerbils..." src="/images/gerbils.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, their fate rests in the trustworthy hands of &lt;a href="http://dirtypcbs.com/"&gt;Dirty
PCBs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruh roh" src="/images/yum_yum_pcbs.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-13:2014/07/13/gerbils-away</guid><category>Electronics</category></item><item><title>Testing LED strips and a PSU</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/11/testing-led-strips-and-a-psu</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I received a lot of parcels today!  The LEDs, thermal compound, some relays,
and what we have affectionately termed The Danger&amp;nbsp;Cable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="schematic" src="/images/danger_cable.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first we weren&amp;#8217;t convinced the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strips would be bright enough.  A quick
test in the garden cleared any doubts about the&amp;nbsp;brightness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lightsabre" src="/images/lightsabre.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I finished putting the power supply back together after a good clean
and a fresh dab of thermal grease.  After a little sanity testing, we thought
we&amp;#8217;d give it some&amp;nbsp;load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="power supply testing" src="/images/psu_test.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power supply seems to work beautifully, although it was only pushing 4A out
of its rated&amp;nbsp;30A!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-11:2014/07/11/testing-led-strips-and-a-psu</guid><category>electronics</category><category>power</category><category>testing</category></item><item><title>Rework and a PCB</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/10/rework-and-a-pcb</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Having made surprisingly short work of reworking the first power supply, a blob
of epoxy sealed the deal.  Testing will have to wait until we get a few more
parts, but it looks&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a number of interesting ideas for making the electronics easier.
Instead of using an Arduino to talk over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; and drive the shift registers (and
have yet another layer of software in the stack), it turns out you can use
several of the pins on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTDI&lt;/span&gt; ft232r as GPIOs and use it to drive shift
registers&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, I was making a quick stripboard prototype with a shift
register and some PMOSes and complaining bitterly to Adam about cutting
stripboard tracks.  We shortly decided that it was, in fact, a rather good idea
to make a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;.  Instead of one massive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;, we could break it down to 7 PCBs,
each with a shift register and 7 outputs.  We can cascade the boards&amp;#8217; shift
registers and connect each board directly to a power supply.  Surprisingly
quickly, the schematic looked something like&amp;nbsp;this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="schematic" src="/images/pcb_schematic.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all just about barely fits on a 5cm x 5cm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt;: (surface mount resistors
omitted for clarity, but they look like they&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;fit&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_55" src="/images/pcb_55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a 10cm x 5cm board, everything gets a lot more comfortable, a looks a
little&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pcb_long" src="/images/pcb_long.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, with the PCBs all lined up the LEDs will look something like a
grid.  In the end we went back to using through-hole components for everything.
Surface mount resistors would be smaller and cheaper, but through-hole is a lot
more&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-10:2014/07/10/rework-and-a-pcb</guid><category>electronics</category><category>power</category></item><item><title>Another day, another order</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/07/another-day-another-order</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, yet more exciting things are on the way, this time in the form of two
sample rolls of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strip.  We couldn&amp;#8217;t decide whether &amp;#8220;Pure/Day White&amp;#8221; or
&amp;#8220;Cool White&amp;#8221; sounded more appropriate, so we&amp;#8217;re going to check out&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, the electronics design is significantly taking shape.  After a
number of iterations and a lot of discussion, we decided we want high-side
driving of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; strip, and therefore P-channel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOSFET&lt;/span&gt; drivers.  This
would&amp;#8217;ve required another row of transistors to interface between our shift
registers and the MOSFETs, except for Matt&amp;#8217;s (thanks!) neat idea of using shift
registers with open-drain drivers.  Prototype parts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt; tomorrow, so we&amp;#8217;ll see
how the idea stands up to&amp;nbsp;testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-07:2014/07/07/another-day-another-order</guid><category>LEDs</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Approval!</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/2014/07/05/approval</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We got approval!  We&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMF&lt;/span&gt; committee to get back to us
about our proposal, and, they did &amp;#8212; The·Grid at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMF2014&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;happening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, I bought £70 worth of 12V PSUs (150A worth) and we set up this&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-05:2014/07/05/approval</guid><category>power</category></item></channel></rss>
