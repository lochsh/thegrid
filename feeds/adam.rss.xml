firm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230; in the past. It slipped slowly further back in time until the
estimated delivery was an hour&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="delivery tracking..." src="images/eta_the_past.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the aluminium did eventually make it to the present time and we happily
took&amp;nbsp;delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="aluminium in the garden" src="images/alu_in_garden.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours of hard sawing, filing and taping up later, and we now have eight
bundles of aluminium angle, all ready to be used for the structural component
of&amp;nbsp;TheGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="adam sawing" src="images/adam_sawing.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also opened up one of the power supplies to investigate the design and
quality. True to the &amp;#8220;Professional&amp;#8221; sticker on the box, the insides included a
large toroid that had torn free of its soldering, so we&amp;#8217;ll probably need to do
a little rework before these are&amp;nbsp;shipshape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="i'm sure this PSU is just fine" src="images/psu_dodgy_transformer.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the prototype electronics have also arrived, so we&amp;#8217;re ready to
start testing the control electronics. Hopefully the first LEDs (to verify
colour choice) will be arriving tomorrow so we can light something&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-09:aluminium-arrived-at-last.html</guid><category>structures</category><category>power</category></item><item><title>PSUs arrived (aluminium didn’t)</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/psus-arrived-aluminium-didnt.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Five of the most legitimate 30A 12V PSUs you can find on eBay arrived today:
&lt;img alt="PSUs arrived" src="/images/psus_arrived.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the aluminium couldn&amp;#8217;t be delivered today so fingers crossed
we&amp;#8217;ll get it&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-08:psus-arrived-aluminium-didnt.html</guid><category>power</category></item><item><title>175m Aluminium Angle on its way…</title><link>http://www.thegrid.fish/175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is all feeling much more real now as we&amp;#8217;ve just placed the order for 35 5m
lengths of aluminium equal angle. It should arrive Tuesday, apparently! I can
only imagine how confused the delivery driver will be when the address is a
residental&amp;nbsp;house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the order" src="/images/alu_order.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve now also finished the prototype design for the control electronics and
ordered a few samples to test drive. Hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll have flashing LEDs by the
end of the&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.thegrid.fish,2014-07-06:175m-aluminium-angle-on-its-way.html</guid><category>structures</category><category>electronics</category></item></channel></rss>
