We're back again! No build log this time (it would have been great though, 
check out our [twitter](https://twitter.com/__thegrid) for some photos etc), 
but we've made a bunch of improvements and can't wait to show you them at EMF 
2016.

More usefully though, the information below on writing your own patterns is 
outdated, please check 
[here](https://github.com/cillian64/thegrid/blob/master/software/README.md) for 
details this time!
